TASE is an international symposium that aims to bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry with interest in the theoretical aspects of software engineering. Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to current software engineering methodologies that need to be enhanced using modern results from theoretical computer science.

Being one of the most prosperous cities in China, Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, located at the north of the Pearl River Delta, the area subsumes Hong Kong and Macau. Historically, Guangzhou is both the start of the Maritime Silk Road and the center of Lingnan Culture.

With the first known settlement in the area back to 1100BC (Cf. wikipedia), Guangzhou has the longest history among the international trade port cities in the world. The China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair) has been held twice a year in the city since 1957.

Guangzhou ranks first in the number of restaurants and tea-houses in the country. As one of the four major food styles of China, Cantonese cuisine is good in color, fragrance, taste and presentation, and is the most widely served style of Chinese cuisine in the world. Yum cha, or dim sum, being one of the most well known light brunch Chinese food, has been welcomed and enjoyed by people all around the world.
