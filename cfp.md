## OVERVIEW

The 12th Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering Conference (TASE 2018) will be held in Guangzhou, China in August, 2018.

Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to the various aspects of software engineering, for instance, software dependability in trusted computing, interaction with physical components in cyber physical systems, distribution in cloud computing applications, etc. Hence, new concepts and methodologies are required to enhance the development of software engineering from theoretical aspects. TASE 2015 aims to provide a forum for people from academia and industry to communicate their latest results on theoretical advances in software engineering. 

TASE 2018 is the 12th in the TASE series. The past TASE symposiums were successfully held in Shanghai ('07), Nanjing ('08), Tianjin ('09), Taipei ('10), Xi'an ('11), Beijing ('12), Birmingham ('13), Changsha('14), Nanjing('15), Shanghai('16) and Nice('17). The proceedings of the TASE 2018 symposium are planned to be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to appear in a special issue of the Science of Computer Programs journal.

## TOPICS

The symposium is devoted to theoretical aspects of software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Abstract interpretation           
* Algebraic and co-algebraic specifications   
* Aspect oriented software           
* Component-based software engineerings   
* Cyber-physical systems           
* Deductive verification   
* Distributed and concurrent systems       
* Embedded and real-time systems   
* Feature-oriented software           
* Formal verification and program semantics    
* Integration of formal methods          
* Language design    
* Model checking and theorem proving
* Model-driven engineering
* Object-oriented systems
* Probability in software engineering
* Program analysis
* Program logics and calculi
* Quantum computation
* Requirements Engineering
* Reverse engineering and software maintenance
* Run-time verification and monitoring
* Semantic web and web services
* Service-oriented and cloud computing
* Software processes and workflows
* Software architectures and design
* Software testing and quality assurance
* Software safety, security and reliability 
* Specification and verification
* Type systems and behavioural typing
* Tools exploiting theoretical results
